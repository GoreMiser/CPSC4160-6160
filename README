	    some that extended previous sprites and some that are brand new 
	main song is the Legend of Zelda theme from the original Legend of Zelda game
	(Custom music to be added in later)
	Known leaks to be coming from manager when exploding the sprite
        player invincible currently(couldn't decrement health)
        boss AI works, but then bugs out
